## Umed project

The main purpose of the application is to make it possible for students to check up their knowledges by studied subjects in medecine.

Subscribed students have full and unlimited access to all the subjects questions during the valid subscription period.
Non-subscribed students have an acess to a limited number of questions.

A student can choose a subject, a theme and a number of questions from available options.
After selecting the available options, a student will have to go through a wizzard and to reply the asked questions.
In the end of the wizzard the total scrore of correct replied answers will be displayed to get an idea of a student's level.

A student can run wizzard as many times as he or she needs.
